# Readme for Family Class

The only method I added which is not within the assignment brief was the checkAncestor method located in the class Family.
The method runs two streams, one to add the current parents of the name put into the function and the second stream runs the
same method on the parents to check those parents.This generates the entire ancestory of a name so it can be checked against the name of
the child to see if they are their own ancestor.
